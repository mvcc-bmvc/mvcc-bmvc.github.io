											<h1>Machine Vision for Climate Change</h1>
											<p><strong>A  workshop at British Machine Vision Conference 2025&nbsp;</strong></p>
									  </header>
									  <p>The <strong>Machine Vision for Climate Change (MVCC)</strong> workshop at <strong>BMVC 2025</strong> aims to bring together researchers and practitioners at the intersection of computer vision and environmental sustainability. The workshop will explore how state-of-the-art machine vision techniques, spanning deep learning models, satellite imagery, UAVs, video, and remote sensing can be applied to address critical climate change challenges. We invite contributions focused on sustainable infrastructure, renewable energy, biodiversity, forestry, agriculture, disaster response, air quality, and climate-related public health. Emphasis will also be placed on ethical and responsible AI, including fairness, energy efficiency, and interpretability of vision models in climate applications. MVCC seeks to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and highlight the transformative potential of visual intelligence in building a sustainable and resilient future.</p>
